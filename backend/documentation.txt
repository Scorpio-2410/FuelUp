what does the following do:
app.app.get("/see-all-dbtables", async (req, res) => {

app - This is your Express application instance that handles HTTP requests and routing.

.get() - This is the HTTP method that defines this route will respond to GET requests.

"/see-all-dbtables" - This is the route path/endpoint URL that clients will access to trigger this handler.

async (req, res) => { - This is the route handler function with two parameters:

  req - The request object containing information about the HTTP request (headers, query parameters, body, etc.)
  res - The response object used to send data back to the client

The async keyword indicates this is an asynchronous function that can use await for database operations or other asynchronous tasks.
